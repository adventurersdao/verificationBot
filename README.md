# verificationBot

This repo contains everything needed to run a basic discord NFT verification bot using ergo API. You need to be somewhat familiar with python, APIs, and discord bots to understand the code, but only a discord bot token, a server ID and a list of your NFT IDs is needed to run it. Just invite the bot you made to your server, and push the start button :)

I am not a professional developer, I made this for myself simply becouse no such discord bot existed before. I am sure there are more optimalised, better thought-out solutions.

You might do whatever you want with the code, if you want to contribute please do so!

I also know this is not a ground breaking thing, just my own small little contribution to the growing ergo ecosystem. If you would like to donate some $erg or NFTs, please send them here:

I never stoped working on this bot, and now for my NFT project (https://twitter.com/AdventurersDAO) we have a game where you can train and level up your NFTs. Join our community if you would like to try it out!

Thank you.
